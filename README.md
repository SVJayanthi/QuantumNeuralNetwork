Predicted Energy(kJ/mol) vs EMT Energy (kJ/mol)


This folder contains the two scripts, the forcefield, the training data, the testing data, and the outputted validation plots
for the neural network model.
neural.py- script to train the model
test.py- script to test the model 
training_data.traj- data used to train the model
validation_data.traj- data used to test the model
calc.amp- the outputted model
